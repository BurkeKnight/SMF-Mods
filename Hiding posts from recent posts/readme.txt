This modification allows the categories, boards and topics of your choices to be removed from the recent post lists.

Just go to
Administration Center » Modification Settings » Recent Posts Setting 
and put the ids of categories, boards and topics you want to remove from recent posts list.

For example if you want to remove category 1 and 2 from the list, just put the category ids like

1,2 (just have a comma in between and don't leave any space).

Same goes for boards and topics also.


- Note: This mod only hides the items in the recent post listing that is shown on the board index.
