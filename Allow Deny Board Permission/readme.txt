By default this modification in doesn't make any considerable changes in your forum and your forum will remain as it is.

This modification helps us the admin to create deny permission for each membergroup(regular/post) per board basis.

With the default permission system of SMF if a member is having more than 1 groups assigned to him/her and even if one of the assigned group is having access to the board, in that case the member has complete access to the board.
This becomes a bit of issue for administrators having a lot of groups on there forums.

Just to make sure that the mod is properly enabled please follow the below mentioned steps:
Administration Center >> Boards >> Settings 
- Enable allow/deny mod (make sure this option is checked)

With this mod you can edit deny board from 2 places

1. Go to
Administration Center >> Boards >> Modify Boards
- Try to add/modify any board
- Just check the member groups you want to deny from accessing this board by selecting the checkboxes in "Deny groups:" region.

2. Or
Administration Center >> Membergroups
- Try to add or edit a membergroup
- Just below visible boards you will be able to see deny board permission too.


All done, the user having the membergroup checked can't access the board anymore even if the other membergroup associated with the user has the access permission.
